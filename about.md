### About Me

I'm broadly interested in Statistics, machine learning and deep learning.

My research involves statistical models, computer vision, machine learning and prediction model using deep neural networks.

I worked as an intern at LG CNS in 2017, and as an trainee at KT in 2018.

I am currently a Research Scientist at YIDS, Yonsei University Institute of Data Science.

I completed my Bachelor's degree at Yonsei University. And I am studying for a Master's degree advised by Prof. Hyunjoong Kim. At Yonsei, I co-taught STA1001 as a TA, Teaching Assistant: Introduction to Statistics in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
