# Expanded Cross-entropy Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks

The loss function extremely affects the performance of a model. How the loss function is defined determines the success of the learning. The cross-entropy loss function is commonly used in models for classification problems.

This paper proposes an extended cross-entropy loss function that complements the crossentropy loss function.

For SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 dataset, we evaluated the accuracy of convolutional neural networks with various structures. In most cases, assuming all the other conditions in same state, the results of the extended cross-entropy loss function were found to increase the classification accuracy
compared to the existing cross-entropy loss function applied.
